## Tips

> - Keep off the `master` branch until release
> - Work in `dev`, or some other staging branch and create a separate feature branch to work on features before merging to the staging branch
> - Merge branches using `git merge --no-ff <branch>` for clear changes
> - Do not `git reset --hard <commit hash>` unless it is breaking
> - Use clear descriptive commit messages but keep it short
